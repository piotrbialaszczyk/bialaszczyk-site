    <h1>About Me</h1>

    <p>Hello! 👋 I'm <strong>Piotr</strong>, a manual QA tester currently working at Samsung Electronics.</p>

    <p>I test mobile devices in areas like <strong>Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and cellular connectivity</strong>. My day-to-day work involves validating complex networking scenarios and ensuring devices meet strict quality standards.</p>

    <p>While I enjoy testing, I’ve realized that many of the tools I use at work are internal and not widely applicable outside the company. That’s why I started this blog — to explore and document my learning as I dive into industry-standard tools and technologies like <strong>Wireshark, Charles Proxy, TestRail, Postman, and maybe even Selenium or Python scripting</strong>.</p>

    <p>I’m not trying to be a 10X developer — I just enjoy learning, solving problems, and building things that work. I believe QA is a creative and essential part of modern software development, and I’m excited to grow further in that direction.</p>

    <p>Outside of tech, I’m a runner currently training for my first marathon. 🏃</p>

    <h2>Contact</h2>
    <p>Feel free to reach out — especially if you're working in testing, hiring, or just curious about what I'm learning.</p>
