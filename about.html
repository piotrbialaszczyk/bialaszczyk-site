    <p>I'm a manual tester currently working at Samsung Electronics, where I validate mobile device connectivity across Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and cellular networks. Alongside testing, I work in a Linux environment, use Git daily, and occasionally write scripts in Python to support my work.</p>

    <p>Testing has been a rewarding challenge, but many of the tools I use at Samsung are internal and not transferable beyond the company. Since 2020, I’ve also been learning Java, though that knowledge has faded somewhat as I’ve focused on manual testing. This has motivated me to return to industry-wide technologies and standards, and to build up skills that are more broadly applicable.</p>

    <p>That’s why I started this blog: to document what I’m learning, explore new tools, and share a few ideas along the way.</p>

    <p>I enjoy learning, solving problems, and building things that work. Currently, I'm also taking part in the <a href="https://www.aidevs.pl/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="highlight-link">AI devs</a> course to deepen my understanding of artificial intelligence and its applications.</p>

    <p>Outside of tech, I’m a runner currently training for my first marathon.</p>
