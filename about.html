        <p>I'm a manual tester at Samsung Electronics, where I validate mobile device connectivity across Wi-Fi,
          Bluetooth, and cellular networks. I work on Linux machines, use CLI and Git every day, and occasionally write
          Python scripts when I need to automate parts of my work. Generally, I&nbsp;am a person who figures out how
          things
          work and fixes them when they don't.</p>

        <p>Working at Samsung has taught me a lot about mobile testing, though most of the tools we use are specific to
          the company. So I started this blog to learn about web tools and technologies that exist beyond Samsung's
          walls, and to share what I discover along the way. Take my work here with a grain of salt as I want to have
          fun while learning (we'll see how that one goes).</p>

        <p>Out of curiosity, I've been learning Java since 2020 and picked up Python during the process, mostly to make
          my testing work easier. Python also turned out to be really helpful for the <a href="https://www.aidevs.pl/"
            class="external-ai" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AI&nbsp;devs</a> course that I'm taking to see how AI
          might
          fit into testing and development work.</p>

        <p>When I'm not staring at screens, I'm usually running. Currently training for my first marathon. You can see
          how that's going on my <a href="https://www.strava.com/athletes/120355261" class="external-strava"
